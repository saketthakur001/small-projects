According to Euclid’s Division Lemma if we have two positive integers a and b, then there exist unique integers q and r which satisfies the condition a = bq + r where 0 ≤ r < b.
Let a be the positive odd integer which when divided by 6 gives q as quotient and r as remainder.
According to Euclid’s division lemma
a = bq + r
a = 6q + r………………….(1)
where, (0 ≤ r < 6)
So r can be either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5.
Case 1:
If r = 1, then equation (1) becomes
a = 6q + 1
The Above equation will be always as an odd integer.
Case 2: 
If r = 3, then equation (1) becomes
a = 6q + 3
The Above equation will be always as an odd integer.
Case 3: 
If r = 5, then equation (1) becomes
a = 6q + 5
The above equation will be always as an odd integer.
∴ Any odd integer is of the form  6q + 1 or 6q + 3 or 6q + 5.
Hence proved.
